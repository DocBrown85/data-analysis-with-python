# Data Analysis with Python
This repo holds exercise notebooks from the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis-python) specialization from Coursera.

## Classification Analysis

1. Introduction to Classification: provides an overview of classification as a supervised learning method. You will also learn the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, understanding its principles and applications in classification tasks.
2. Decision Tree Classification: explore the Decision Tree algorithm, learning its structure, construction, and applications in classification problems.
3. Support Vector Machine Classification: focuses on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, where you will grasp its principles and how it is used for classification.
4. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression: delves into two essential classifiers: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. You will gain insights into their assumptions, strengths, and applications.
5. Classification Evaluation: provides techniques on how to evaluate the performance of classifiers using various metrics and visualization techniques.

## Regression Analysis
1. Introduction to Regression and Linear Regression: delves into the concepts of linear regression, understanding its principles, assumptions, and practical applications.
2. Polynomial Regression: explores polynomial regression, an advanced technique used to capture nonlinear relationships between variables.
3. Regularization: focuses on regularization techniques, including Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net, which help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of regression models.
4. Evaluation and Cross Validation: explores evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques to assess and optimize regression model performance.
5. Ensemble Methods: explores ensemble methods in regression analysis, including bagging and boosting, to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.

## Clustering Analysis
1. Introduction to Partitioning and Clustering: provides an introduction to unsupervised learning and clustering analysis. You will delve into partitioning clustering methods, such as K-Means and K-Medoids, understanding their principles and applications.
2. Hierarchical Clustering: explores hierarchical clustering, a method that creates a tree-like structure to represent data similarities.
3. Density Based Clusering: focuses on density-based clustering, which groups data points based on their density within the dataset.
4. Grid Based Clustering: explores grid-based clustering, an approach that partitions the data space into grids for efficient clustering.
5. Dimension Reduction Methods: introduces dimension reduction techniques as a critical preprocessing step for handling high-dimensional data.
