# Data Analysis with Python
This repo holds exercise notebooks from the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis-python) specialization from Coursera.

## Classification Analysis

1. Introduction to Classification: provides an overview of classification as a supervised learning method. You will also learn the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, understanding its principles and applications in classification tasks.
2. Decision Tree Classification: explore the Decision Tree algorithm, learning its structure, construction, and applications in classification problems.
3. Support Vector Machine Classification: focuses on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, where you will grasp its principles and how it is used for classification.
4. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression: delves into two essential classifiers: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. You will gain insights into their assumptions, strengths, and applications.
5. Classification Evaluation: provides techniques on how to evaluate the performance of classifiers using various metrics and visualization techniques.
